For this assignment, I made my bot support Bernie Sanders. My score on project 04 should be 31/30. I completed all of the tasks in `bot.py`, gaining 12 points. I completed this GitHub repo according to the guidelines posted, gaining 3 more points. I also received 1000 valid comments, receiving 10 more points. 

Here is the outcome of my bot_counter.py file:

 ```
len(comments)= 1000
len(top_level_comments)= 109
len(replies)= 891
len(valid_top_level_comments)= 109
len(not_self_replies)= 891
len(valid_replies)= 891
========================================
valid_comments= 1000
========================================
NOTE: the number valid_comments will be used to determine your grade
```

Additionally, I created a `bot_submissions.py` file with more than 200 submissions, which is worth two extra points. I also created the `bot_vote.py` file to have my bot downvote any comment or submission that mentions Trump. I also used the textblob sentiment analysis library to determine the sentiment of all the posts that mention my least favorite candidate and overall had more than 100 submissions. This is worth 4 points in total.

This is my favorite thread involving my bot because you can see that it is interacting with itself and at the same time each comment complements the other. This is the [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/cs40_2022fall/comments/ywdc19/comment/ixe21jg/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) to comment one and this is the [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/cs40_2022fall/comments/ywdc19/comment/ixc10lx/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) to comment two of the thread.
